# Nextclade Workflow for &lt;your virus&gt;

This repository contains a robust, reproducible workflow for building a custom [Nextclade](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade) dataset for &lt;your virus&gt;. It enables you to generate reference and annotation files, download and process sequence data, infer an ancestral sequence, and create all files needed for Nextclade analyses and visualization.

---
## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Set up folders
mkdir -p dataset data ingest resources results scripts

# 2. Generate reference files
python3 scripts/generate_from_genbank.py --reference "<accession>" --output-dir dataset/

# 3. Configure pathogen.json (edit manually)

# 4. If first time, enable inference in Snakefile:
# Set INFERRENCE_RERUN = True

# 5. Run workflow
snakemake --cores 9 all --config static_inference_confirmed=true
```

See detailed instructions below for each step.

## Folder Structure

Follow the [Nextclade example workflow](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade_data/tree/master/docs/example-workflow) or use the structure below:

```bash
mkdir -p dataset data ingest resources results scripts
```

---

## Workflow Overview

This workflow is composed of several modular steps:

1. **Reference Generation**  
   Extracts relevant reference and annotation files from GenBank.
2. **Dataset Ingest**  
   Downloads and processes sequences and metadata from NCBI Virus.
3. **Inferred Ancestral Root (Recommended)**  
   Uses outgroup rooting to infer a dataset-specific ancestral sequence. This is rooted on a *Static Inferred Ancestor* — a phylogenetically reconstructed sequence at the MRCA (most recent common ancestor) of the ingroup, which provides a stable, biologically accurate reference point for mutation and clade assignments. This approach addresses the issue that the Reference differs substantially from currently circulating strains.
4. **Augur Phylogenetics & Nextclade Preparation**  
   Builds trees rooted on the inferred ancestor, prepares multiple sequence alignments, and generates all files required for Nextclade and Auspice.
5. **Visualization & Analysis**  
   Enables both command-line and web-based Nextclade analyses, including local dataset hosting.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Generate Reference Files

Run the script to extract the reference FASTA and genome annotation from GenBank:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_from_genbank.py --reference "<accession>" --output-dir dataset/
```

During the script execution, follow the prompts for CDS annotation selection.
   - `[0]`
   - `[product]` or `[leave empty for manual choice]` to select proteins.
   - `[2]`.

**Outputs:**
- `dataset/reference.fasta`
- `dataset/genome_annotation.gff3`

---

### 2. Configure `pathogen.json`

Edit `pathogen.json` to:
- Reference your generated files (`reference.fasta`, `genome_annotation.gff3`)
- Update metadata and QC settings as needed  
> [!WARNING]  
> If QC is not set, Nextclade will skip quality checks.

See the [Nextclade pathogen config documentation](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/latest/user/input-files/05-pathogen-config.html) for details.

---

### 3. Prepare GenBank Reference

Copy your GenBank file to `resources/reference.gb` and edit it to ensure compatibility with the workflow.

**Important requirements:**
- Each coding sequence (CDS) must have either a `product` or `gene` name present
- The annotation keys must **match exactly** between `reference.gb` and `genome_annotation.gff3`
- Use simple, consistent names (e.g., `product="VP1"` instead of `product="VP1_protein"`)
- Remove any genes that are not relevant for your dataset

> [!WARNING]  
> Mismatched or inconsistent gene names will cause `augur ancestral` to fail, as it cannot match features across files. Ensure your protein names match those defined in the `GENES` list in the [Snakefile](/Snakefile#L4).

---

### 4. Update the `Snakefile`

- Adjust the workflow parameters and file paths as needed for your dataset.
- Ensure required files are available:
  - `data/sequences.fasta`
  - `data/metadata.tsv`
  - `resources/auspice_config.json`

Sequences and metadata can be downloaded automatically via the ingest process (see below).

---

## Subprocesses

### Ingest

Automates downloading of &lt;your viral&gt; sequences and metadata from NCBI Virus.  
See [ingest/README.md](ingest/README.md) for specifics.

**Required packages:**  
`csvtk, nextclade, tsv-utils, seqkit, zip, unzip, entrez-direct, ncbi-datasets-cli` (installable via conda-forge/bioconda)

---

### Inferred Ancestral Root with Outgroup Rooting (Recommended)

The `inferred-root/` directory contains a reproducible pipeline that uses **outgroup rooting** to infer a dataset-specific ancestral sequence for &lt;your virus&gt;. This method:

- **Builds a phylogenetic tree** including both &lt;your viral&gt; sequences (ingroup) and related enterovirus sequences (outgroup)
- **Roots the tree on the outgroup** to establish correct evolutionary directionality
- **Extracts the ancestral sequence** at the MRCA of all &lt;your viral&gt; sequences
- **Fills gaps** with reference nucleotides to ensure a complete, biologically plausible genome

This **Static Inferred Ancestor** serves as the root of your Nextclade dataset, providing:
- More accurate mutation calls relative to a realistic &lt;your virus&gt; ancestor
- A stable reference that better represents &lt;your viral&gt; diversity than the distant Reference sequence 

#### Configuration

The workflow has two key parameters in the main `Snakefile`:
- `STATIC_ANCESTRAL_INFERRENCE = True` — enables using the inferred root (default: `True`)
- `INFERRENCE_RERUN = False` — controls whether to regenerate the inferred root (default: `False`)

#### For Regular Dataset Builds

Use the existing inferred root:

```bash
snakemake --cores 9 all
```

#### To Regenerate the Inferred Root

When you need to regenerate with new data or updated outgroups:

1. Set `INFERRENCE_RERUN = True` in the Snakefile
2. Run the workflow:
   ```bash
   snakemake --cores 9 all --config static_inference_confirmed=true
   ```
3. The workflow will:
   - Clean previous results in `inferred-root/results/`
   - Run the full inference pipeline with your current sequences
   - Generate a new `resources/inferred-root.fasta`
   - Incorporate it into the dataset build
4. After successful regeneration, set `INFERRENCE_RERUN = False` for future runs

> [!WARNING]  
> Setting `INFERRENCE_RERUN = True` will **overwrite** your existing `resources/inferred-root.fasta` file and clear `inferred-root/results/`. Only use this when you want to regenerate the root with updated data.

> [!NOTE]  
> - **First-time users:** If `resources/inferred-root.fasta` doesn't exist, you must set `INFERRENCE_RERUN = True` initially.
> - **To disable this feature:** Set `STATIC_ANCESTRAL_INFERRENCE = False` and change `ROOTING` parameter (e.g., `ROOTING="mid_point"`).
> - **Outgroup configuration:** Sequences are in `resources/outgroup/`; update the `OUTGROUP` list in `inferred-root/Snakefile` to modify which species are used.

**See:** [`inferred-root/README.md`](inferred-root/README.md) for technical details and the complete workflow.

## Running the Workflow

To generate the Auspice JSON and Nextclade dataset:

```bash
snakemake --cores 9 all
```

This will use the existing inferred root (see [Inferred Ancestral Root](#inferred-ancestral-root-with-outgroup-rooting-recommended) section above for regeneration instructions).

The workflow will:
- Build the reference tree rooted on the inferred ancestor
- Produce the Nextclade dataset in `out-dataset/`
- Run Nextclade on example sequences
- Output results to `test_out/` (alignment, translations, summary TSV)

**Key Snakefile parameters:**
- `ROOTING = "ancestral_sequence"` — roots tree on the inferred ancestor
- `STATIC_ANCESTRAL_INFERRENCE = True` — enables inferred root in the dataset (default)
- `INFERRENCE_RERUN = False` — set to `True` only when regenerating the root (default: `False`)

### Labeling Mutations of Interest

To label mutations of interest, execute the `mutLabels` rule as a standalone instance. They will be added to the `out-dataset/pathogen.json` file.

---

## Visualizing Your Custom Nextclade Dataset

To use the dataset in Nextclade Web, serve it locally:

```bash
serve --cors out-dataset -l 3000
```

Then open:

```
https://master.clades.nextstrain.org/?dataset-url=http://localhost:3000
```

- Click "Load example", then "Run"
- You may want to reduce "Max. nucleotide markers" to 500 under "Settings" → "Sequence view" to optimize performance


## Test / validation (`rule test`)

The workflow includes a Snakemake `rule test` which builds a **mixed test set** (real sequences + generated edge cases) and runs **Nextclade CLI** against the newly assembled dataset. This is intended as a quick regression check when you change QC rules or alignment parameters.

### Run
```bash
snakemake --cores 9 test
```

### What it does
- Creates synthetic test inputs (fragments + recombinants) with:
  - `scripts/generate_test_sequences.py`
- Combines:
  - dataset sequences (`data/sequences.fasta`)
  - example sequences included in the dataset
  - generated fragments + recombinants
  - negative controls in `testing/` (e.g. `testing/non-EV-A_sequence.fasta`)
  - optional EV-A background sequences (`testing/EV_A.fasta`, or fetched from NCBI if missing)
- Runs `nextclade3 run` using the freshly built `dataset.zip`
- Parses the Nextclade run log and outputs summaries / failed sequences using:
  - `scripts/parse_nextclade_log.py`

### Outputs
All outputs are written to `test_out/` (Nextclade outputs + aggregated test FASTAs, logs, and any derived summaries).
The Nextclade CLI log is saved to `testing/test.log`.
